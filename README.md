## Hisham, Ammar, Kenan Random Geolocation Change Project

We built this project using [Googleâ€™s Geolocation API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/geolocation) and NordVPN API to locate the current location of the viewer and the location based on the VPN server location.
